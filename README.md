-------------------

This repository is dedicated to give first inspirations on how to tackle general business use cases, each folder denotes one use case.

The folder "churn_prediction" depicts the general concept of how to tackle a problem of 'customer churn prediction'. 
The dataset used in this repository is the KAGGLE dataset for "churn for bank customers": https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/churn-for-bank-customers .

As all complete data science projects, it comprises the following parts: 
- business and data understanding 
- exploratory data analysis (EDA) 
- data preparation 
- modeling 
- model evaluation 

Please, beware that in real-world scenarios, these parts are undergone iteratively before a model is deployed. And after such model deployment, the maintenance and updating of the model also needs such continuous iterations.
