- 👋 Hi, I’m @minye
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and blockchain technologies:
  - data science from Machine Learning, related cloud engineering and from business perspectives
  - blockchain technologies with a focus on smart contracts - and I love drawing, so also interested in NFTs
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about blockchain and smart contracts. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to:
  - data science: I bring experience in the areas of (data science in) biomedicine, legal tech, IoT.
  - web3: learning about smart contracts and love drawing myself 
- 📫 How to reach me:

This repository is dedicated to depict the general concept of how to tackle a problem of 'customer churn prediction'. 
The dataset used in this repository is the KAGGLE dataset for "churn for bank customers": https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/churn-for-bank-customers .

As all complete data science projects, it comprises the following parts: 
- business and data understanding 
- exploratory data analysis (EDA) 
- data preparation 
- modeling 
- model evaluation 

Please, beware that in real-world scenarios, these parts are undergone iteratively before a model is deployed. And after such model deployment, the maintenance and updating of the model also needs such continuous iterations.
